#Linear and Ridge regressions
This contribution develops an analysis on the dataset 'bad-drivers.csv' (taken from github.com/fivethirtyeight/data) by considering two models: the linear regression and the ridge regression. In particular, the analysis is focused con the computation of the predictions of the variable y, following the partition of the dataset into training set and test set. Finally, the study aims to find the best value of lambda used in the ridge regression, passing through the computation of the regularization parameter ??.
